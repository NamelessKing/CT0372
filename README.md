## Repository structure
This IntelliJ project is divided into two main modules:
* `book`
* `custom`
### book 
Inside `book` are collected all the exercises related to
our text book: ["Concetti di informatica e fondamenti di Java,
sesta edizione per Java 7 e Java 8"](http://www.apogeoeducation.com/concetti-di-informatica-e-fondamenti-di-java.html), 
Cay Horstmann, Italian version.
The structure of the packages and the relative association with 
chapters and exercises inside the book 
is the following: `it.unive.ch<chapter number>.e<exercise number>`.

### custom
